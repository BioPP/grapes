This software needs cmake >= 2.8 to build.

The dependencies include:
- Bio++ libraries: bpp-core, seq, phyl
- The GSL library.

After installing cmake, run it with the following command:
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=[where to install, for instance /usr/local or $HOME/.local] .

If available, you can also use ccmake instead of cmake for a more user-friendly interface.

Then compile and install the software with
make install

In order to build standalone executable, run

cmake -DBUILD_STATIC=yes -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=[where to install, for instance /usr/local or $HOME/.local] .

or use the ccmake terminal interface.

You may also consider installing and using the software checkinstall for easier system administration.
